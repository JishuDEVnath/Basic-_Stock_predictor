## Basic_Stock_predictor - 

This is a basic stock predictor streamlit webapp using ML.

1. If you want to try this, firstly upload the ipynb file to any online jupyter notebook(eg: googlecolab, kaggle or you can use the jupyter notebook).

2. Then install all the important requrirements in the app.py file such as pandas , numpy, pyplot, yfinance etc. suing pip or venv in the terminal of your project.

3. You also need to install streamlit using pip or venv in the same terminal to run the project in the webapp an then you are all set to go.  

In this project I have used vscode inbuilt jupyter notebook but you can use any online notebook.

Run the app.py from the terminal by typing 'streamlit run app.py'.
